Casino Texas Hold'em Game
This is Casino Texas Hold'em in browser. Actual money is not use so money is made up. The cash out button does not work and is theoretical.
The rules are as follows:
        Your cards are on the bottom of the screen. The dealer's are at the top and in the center is the shared table. This
        is Casino Holdem rules. You choose your ante and after the flop you decide to call for double your ante amount or
        fold. If you call, two more cards are placed on the board and the dealer shows his cards. If the dealer has any play
        less than a pair of 4's, he automatically loses and you don't recieve chips on your call bet. You will recieve a
        multiplier of your original ante upon winning depending on the rarity of your hand, the standard being 1:1 for a
        straight or less. Version notes: Cash out feature is currently unavailable.
